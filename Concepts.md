# Concepts

This is a collection of concepts that are necessary for following & contributing to discussions within the open memetics community. This is the basis of our shared language that balances onboarding newcomers & expressing the necessary complexity needed to expand our frontier.

**ABU Reaction** - Categorizing a post, article, or other published material as falling into one of three categories: new and apparently true, true but already known, and doubtful.
	- _A - “true & useful, AND new to me”_
	- _B - “true & useful, but NOT novel”_
	- _U - “unclear, undefined, unknowable, or just flat out wrong”_
	- See [Rate Me: A, B, or U](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/rate-me-a-b-or-u)

**epistemic noise** - any information that makes it difficult to surface the truths the observer seeks. Usually because it's false, irrelevant, or worse: is true but guides you towards false conclusions.

<summary>Examples:</summary>

_Example: the [Streisand Deflect](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Streisand+Deflect) is an example of epistemic noise because it injects true information into the system to hide a specific truth._

_Example 2: an engineer writing a design doc pointing out all the flaws in a proposed system, only because it threatens their team's headcount. Everything in the doc is true, but it fails to convince the discerning reader. It's designed to convince those with less discernment, like decision makers up the management chain. This is sometimes referred to as [Gish gallop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop)_

_See also: [Gish gallop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop) is a rhetorical technique in which a person in a debate attempts to overwhelm an opponent by presenting an excessive number of arguments._

**memetic attraction** - a unit of information is said to have a "pull" force towards the observer if they gain value from it upon contact. Understanding the forces acting upon information allows us to map the landscape. 

For example: a working solution to a known open problem has a natural "pull". You'd expect that if that piece of information exists, it will find its way to the relevant authority. The absence of it tells us that 

1. the information does NOT exist, OR 
2. there is a blockage/epistemic noise/censorship in the environment
