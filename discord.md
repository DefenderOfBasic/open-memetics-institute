# Open Memetics Discord

There is a discord group for the Open Memetics Institute. 

It is currently "publicly hidden". As in, the link is technically public. It is technically open to the public. It's just not very visible. It's buried in a random web page somewhere on the internet. It doesn't really come up when you search the relevant search terms. 

This is kind of an "accidental experiment". I've been trying to advertise this discord for months, and we've had a trickle. Now there's a lot of interest all of a sudden, more than we can handle. We're not closing it off, but it sounded fun to just leave it exactly as obvious as it currently is, and ask people as they come in "how did you find it?"

There are currently 3 categories:

1. I heard about it "on the internet", via Defender, or via EtymologyNerd, and googled & found the link
2. I heard about it "IRL", and then googled it and found it
3. I already knew someone in there and they invited me

If you do manage to find it, it's up to you whether you want to write about it to make it more legible to more people like you or not. We're essentially missing "onboarding docs" and anyone who steps up and does them will be the "de facto" onboarding doc until something replaces it.

Good luck, and thanks for playing!!!
