# Concepts

This is a collection of concepts that are necessary for following & contributing to discussions within the open memetics community. This is the basis of our shared language that balances onboarding newcomers & expressing the necessary complexity needed to expand our frontier.

**epistemic noise** - any information that makes it difficult to surface the truths the observer seeks. Usually because it's false, irrelevant, or worse: is true but guides you towards false conclusions. 

<details>
<summary>Examples:</summary>

_Example: the [Streisand Deflect](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Streisand+Deflect) is an example of epistemic noise because it injects true information into the system to hide a specific truth._

_Example 2: an engineer writing a design doc pointing out all the flaws in a proposed system, only because it threatens their team's headcount. Everything in the doc is true, but it fails to convince the discerning reader. It's designed to convince those with less discernment, like decision makers up the management chain. This is sometimes referred to as [Gish gallop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop)_

_See also: [Gish gallop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop) is a rhetorical technique in which a person in a debate attempts to overwhelm an opponent by presenting an excessive number of arguments._

**memetic attraction** - a unit of information is said to have a "pull" force towards the observer if they gain value from it upon contact. Understanding the forces acting upon information allows us to map the landscape. 

For example: a working solution to a known open problem has a natural "pull". You'd expect that if that piece of information exists, it will find its way to the relevant authority. The absence of it tells us that 

1. the information does NOT exist, OR 
2. there is a blockage/epistemic noise/censorship in the environment

### **Relationship between memes, beliefs, memeplexes, and egregores**

[Meme] → smallest informational unit (a phrase, gesture, symbol, or behavior e.g “you're absolutly right”)
    ↓ clusters into
[Memeplex] → set of related memes (“**AI Doomerism:** “We’re building our own replacement.” • “Control problem.” • “Paperclip maximizer.” • “AI safety now.”)
    ↓ internalized as
[Beliefs] → accepted worldview (“AI will save us” / "AI will be the end of us")
    ↓ collectively shared by
[Egregore] → collective mind agent made of believers (“e.g. ideologies”)

### **Memetic (Belief) Pressure System**

An environment where a belief or memeplex maintains itself through collective belief and opposition.  
Like atmospheric systems, beliefs exhibit pressure differentials:
- **High-pressure** — majority consensus, stable
- **Low-pressure** — minority-held, volatile  

Pressure differentials between competing beliefs create conditions for rapid opinion shifts.

_Example:_  
"Cryptocurrency is the future" vs "Cryptocurrency is a scam" creates a pressure differential. Opposition fuels engagement and justification.

_Example 2:_  
Early civil rights beliefs operated as low-pressure systems—minority positions fighting to survive against high-pressure consensus. The conflict lines (fronts) formed wherever these beliefs clashed with the status quo.

### **Low-Pressure Belief**

A minority-held belief, often outside the Overton window. Without continuous engagement and new adherents, it risks dissolving.  

Low-pressure beliefs are inherently unstable and require active maintenance through conversation, justification, and opposition to survive.

_Example:_  
"Universal Basic Income" functioned as a low-pressure belief for decades—a fringe idea that required constant intellectual defense to prevent dissolution. Only when conditions shifted (automation anxiety, pandemic shocks) did it gain enough pressure to spawn stronger conflict lines.

_Example 2:_  
Any startup challenging an established industry begins with a low-pressure belief ("this new way is viable"). "Remote work is viable" was low-pressure until COVID created conditions for rapid pressure gain.

**The risk:** Without fresh engagement or a triggering event, low-pressure beliefs fade from collective consciousness.

---

### **Conflict Lines (Memetic Fronts)**

The boundaries where opposing beliefs meet and egregores mobilize.  
Like weather fronts, these are where the most dramatic shifts occur. Conflict lines form when people must choose sides, creating **pro / contra / neutral** positions.

_Example:_  
The conflict line between "AI will save us" and "AI will destroy us" forces people to pick a stance. Those on the boundary—entertaining "it depends"—are most susceptible to flipping sides.

_Example 2:_  
"Move fast and break things" vs "Move slow and build responsibly" created a conflict line in tech culture. The FTX collapse shifted many minds from the former to the latter—a front passing through.

---

### **Information Stream**

The flow of attention and conversation.  
Like bends in a jet stream create pressure differentials, major events accelerate or decelerate information flow—spawning new beliefs or strengthening existing ones (and enabling egregores to recruit).

_Example:_  
A disputed election accelerates conversations about freedom and legitimacy; egregores organized around liberty gain recruits. Once critical mass is reached → potential revolution.

_Example 2:_  
COVID accelerated conversations about remote work, public health authority, and government overreach simultaneously—spawning multiple competing egregores that are still active years later.

_Example 3:_  
A major security breach accelerates conversations about privacy. An economic crisis accelerates conversations about monetary systems.  
The pattern: **Action creates information. Events are bends in the information stream.**

---

### **Egregore Emergence**

The formation of a collective mind agent around a stabilized memeplex.  
Often begins with low-pressure beliefs that self-sustain through opposition (conflict lines) and, if successful, later through **inertia** (consensus).  

Requires either:
1. A significant information-acceleration event, or  
2. Deliberately manufacturing conflict lines around an idea until it reaches critical mass.

---

### **High-Pressure Belief**

A majority-held position, often inside the Overton window.  
These ideas are stable, self-reinforcing, and require little active defense because consensus maintains them.

_Example:_  
A startup reaches egregoric critical mass when customers (members of the emerging egregore) defend it unprompted, critics emerge organically (creating conflict lines), and the idea spreads without the founder's direct involvement.

_Example 2:_  
"Democracy is the best system of government" operates as high-pressure in many Western societies—it's the default assumption that requires little justification.

**Marker:** High-pressure beliefs feel like *common sense* rather than contested ideas.

---

### **Belief Pressure Reversal (Consensus Reversal)**

When a low-pressure (minority) belief accumulates enough adherents and justification to flip into high-pressure (majority consensus)—or vice versa.  
These reversals often happen rapidly once a threshold is crossed.

_Example:_  
In tech, "move fast and break things" functioned as high-pressure through the 2010s; a series of high-salience failures and regulatory pressure shifted consensus toward "move deliberately and build responsibly," flipping the local pressure.

_Example 2:_  
"Climate change is real" was low-pressure (scientific minority) in the 1980s–90s, became contested through the 2000s, then reversed to high-pressure (consensus) by ~2015–2018. Denialism became the new low-pressure position.
