# Memes for Human Flourishing

This is a collection of narratives that are candidates for spreading. The idea is to document things we are trying to spread, compare notes, coordinate, evolve them for greater memetic fitness. In the same way software developers create modules that can be reused and forked, these are narratives that can be reused and forked. It's a toolkit people can take & use in real life & report back. 

- [Destigmatize being dumb](./destigmatize-being-dumb.md) - removing the stigma around asking dumb questions improves teams, companies, communities & society.
- [the outgroup is not the enemy](./outgroup-is-not-enemy.md) - instead of "X is bad, Y is good" -> "These parts of X are bad, these parts of X are good, same for Y"
- Self sacrifice is a happiness ponzi scheme - https://x.com/DefenderOfBasic/status/1849472381888160221
- Money is not the bottleneck to improving society

#### TODO:

- "the myth of the unbiased / netural journalist" -> there is no such thing. It's a narrative that benefits bad actors.
- How do you spread "win win" thinking as a meme? Or the triple "win win win" (good for you, me, and the world).
  - important because a lot of low hanging fruit is due to people taking it for granted that war is inevitable, that consumers & companies are not on the same side
