# Open Memetics Institute

**Current status (Oct 2025)**: A loose cluster of people all working on similar things (monitoring the memetic landscape, raising the epistemic waterline, and actively attempting to shape culture). 

The upcoming milestone is to form an open coalition similar to [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) but for memetics.
