# Directory 

This is a list of members of the institute and what they are working on.

### Defender

- https://x.com/DefenderOfBasic

Universal translator (between tribes, cultures, languages). ["Anatomy of an Internet Argument"](https://defenderofthebasic.substack.com/p/anatomy-of-an-internet-argument) is a series that teaches how to do this translation 1 on 1 with real people from different tribes. This is useful for A/B testing narratives "in the field" and evolving them/finding the right, mapping out what is spreading, etc. 

Also working on outreach & coordination.

### Sun 乌龟

- https://x.com/suntzoogway

Working on formal theory & a framework for human alignment across all tribes & religions. A kind of "base translation layer".

### Volky

- https://x.com/volkyeth

Writing software for a new medium of internet discourse. This is useful for making egregores visible, making populations more resistant to narratives that do not align with their values. [See project summary here](https://x.com/volkyeth/status/1863281120927760692)

### Ray Doraisamy
