# Concepts

This is a collection of concepts that are necessary for following & contributing to discussions within the open memetics commuity. It's a community curated shared language that tries to balance onboarding newcomers with expressing the necessary complexity at the frontier. 


there are a few basic components that make up the relationships in an environment and i wrote up a small hopefully usable and buildable definition that we can start with to explain some other virtualist concepts:


Agents

Agents act according to their desires and along a pre-predictive (not pre-determined) path. 


Agents receive inputs, they process the information through their existing knowledge and experiences, and they compose an output for the world




The Environment 
-The environment refers to the space where agents are contained.


In most contexts, it will refer to specific websites, locations, or “the internet” as a whole.


Environments can be modified in various ways




In an environment, agents produce signals.

they do this (generally) in response to a different signal, or as a way to express some internal need.




Not all agents are authentic.


While many agents are genuine and truthseeking, some are either intentionally malevolent, uninformed, or a bot.


In these cases, we can use a few different terms for the ways signals are perceived 


For now, lets keep it simple with “signaling that is true”, or “signaling that is false” (for whatever reason)

these concepts allow us to learn more later, about infowar and information engagements







When considering agents in the environment from an outside perspective, we need to also keep in perspective the subjective experiences of the agent. 


For example, there will be times where the agent is presenting a truth that is a truth for them, but is a false in the “universal” sense of information.





With many agents in an environment, there is cross contamination of signals, and dissonance between signals. 


This can be thought of as a kind of “epistemic overload”, where it is unknown what is true and what is false.


This generates what Defender calls epistemic noise. Many agents are overwhelmed and unable to process enough information, even with advanced tactics. 

Many would say that this is a disaster. Having bots, malicious agents, tricksters, and more taking up the internet away from all the kind hearted truthers out there IN ADDITION to all the good kind hearted truthers.


Through this overload of information, agents can develop a sense for wading through epistemic noise. Codex called this “using nyquist theorem”, combining bits and pieces from multiple sources and comparing them to determine “real” information. 


Familiarity with certain patterns of information can help form and craft the understanding space of an agent




Understanding space

The understanding space is the information space that an agent contains.


In this paper https://vec2vec.github.io Harnessing the Universal Geometry of Embeddings

the idea that is explored, is that all models share a universal “platonic representation space”.


This is the universal understanding space. It contains “information gathered” from all agents within, because it’s a superset that contains everything.



Each agent inside of this superset has their own coordinates within “information embedding space”. They have their own understanding space that interacts with information in its own unique way.


This influences the way that incoming information, incoming entropy, interacts with their agent and the predicted response of the agent
