# Concepts

This is a collection of concepts that are necessary for following & contributing to discussions within the open memetics community. This is the basis of our shared language that balances onboarding newcomers & expressing the necessary complexity needed to expand our frontier.

**epistemic noise** - any information that makes it difficult to surface the truths the observer seeks. Usually because it's false, irrelevant, or worse: is true but guides you towards false conclusions.

<summary>Examples:</summary>

_Example: the [Streisand Deflect](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Streisand+Deflect) is an example of epistemic noise because it injects true information into the system to hide a specific truth._

_Example 2: an engineer writing a design doc pointing out all the flaws in a proposed system, only because it threatens their team's headcount. Everything in the doc is true, but it fails to convince the discerning reader. It's designed to convince those with less discernment, like decision makers up the management chain. This is sometimes referred to as [Gish gallop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop)_

_See also: [Gish gallop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gish_gallop) is a rhetorical technique in which a person in a debate attempts to overwhelm an opponent by presenting an excessive number of arguments._

**memetic attraction** - a unit of information is said to have a "pull" force towards the observer if they gain value from it upon contact. Understanding the forces acting upon information allows us to map the landscape. 

For example: a working solution to a known open problem has a natural "pull". You'd expect that if that piece of information exists, it will find its way to the relevant authority. The absence of it tells us that 

1. the information does NOT exist, OR 
2. there is a blockage/epistemic noise/censorship in the environment

**egregore pressure system** - an idea that maintains itself through collective belief and opposition. Like atmospheric pressure systems, egregores create differentials: high-pressure (majority consensus, stable) and low-pressure (minority belief, volatile). The pressure differential between competing ideas creates the conditions for rapid belief change.

Example: "Cryptocurrency is the future" vs "Cryptocurrency is a scam" creates a pressure differential. Neither side can exist without the other. The opposition fuels engagement and justification.

Example 2: Early civil rights movements operated as low-pressure systems—minority beliefs fighting to survive against high-pressure consensus. The conflict lines (fronts) formed wherever these beliefs clashed with the status quo.

**low-pressure egregore** - a minority-held belief, often outside the Overton window. Without continuous engagement and new adherents, it risks dissolving. Low-pressure egregores are inherently unstable and require active maintenance through conversation, justification, and opposition to survive.

Example: "Universal Basic Income" was a low-pressure egregore for decades—a fringe idea that required constant intellectual defense to prevent dissolution. Only when economic conditions shifted (automation anxiety, COVID) did it gain enough pressure to spawn conflict lines.

Example 2: Any startup challenging an established industry begins as a low-pressure egregore. "Remote work is viable" was low-pressure until COVID created conditions for rapid pressure gain.

The risk: without fresh engagement or a triggering event, low-pressure egregores fade from collective consciousness.

----

**conflict lines** (memetic fronts) - the boundaries where opposing egregores meet. Like weather fronts, these are where the most dramatic shifts occur. Conflict lines form when people must choose sides, creating pro/contra/neutral positions. 

Example: The conflict line between "AI will save us" and "AI will destroy us" forces people to pick a stance. Those on the boundary—entertaining "it depends"—are most susceptible to flipping sides.

Example 2: "Move fast and break things" vs "Move slow and build responsibly" created a conflict line in tech culture. The FTX collapse shifted many minds from the former to the latter—a front passing through.

----

**information stream** - the flow of attention and conversation. Like bends in a jet stream creats pressure differentials, major events accelerate or decelerate information flow, spawning new egregores or strengthening existing ones.

Example: A fraudulent election, conversations about freedom accelerate, egregores around liberty gain pressure, once critical mass is reached → revolution.

Example 2: COVID accelerated conversations about remote work, public health authority, and government overreach simultaneously—spawning multiple competing egregores that are still active years later.
Example 3: A major security breach accelerates conversations about privacy. A economic crisis accelerates conversations about monetary systems.
The pattern: Action creates information. Events are bends in the information stream.

----

**egregore emergance** - the birth of a new belief system that initially self-sustains through opposition (conflict lines), later through intertia (critical consensus). Requires either (1) a significant information acceleration event, or (2) deliberately manufacturing conflict lines around an idea until it reaches critical mass.

----

**high-pressure egregore** - a majority-held belief, often inside the Overton window. These ideas are stable, self-reinforcing, and require little active defense because consensus maintains them.

Example 1: A startup reaches egregoric critical mass when customers start defending it unprompted, when critics emerge organically (creating conflict lines), and when the idea spreads without the founder's direct involvement.

Example 2: "Democracy is the best system of government" operates as high-pressure in Western societies—it's the default assumption that requires little justification._

The marker: High-pressure egregores feel like "common sense" rather than contested ideas.

----

**egregore preasure reversal**
 When a low-pressure (minority) belief accumulates enough adherents and justification to flip into high-pressure (majority consensus), or vice versa. These reversals often happen rapidly once a threshold is crossed. The conflict line—"support vs. accountability"—became impossible to ignore as the pressure differential narrowed and then reversed.

Example: "Unconditional support for Israel" was high-pressure in Western discourse for decades. After sustained documentation of Gaza's destruction reached critical visibility, "cut Israel's funding" shifted from fringe (low-pressure) to high-pressure. The conflict line—"support vs. accountability"—became impossible to ignore as the pressure differential narrowed.

Example 2: "Climate change is real" was low-pressure (scientific minority) in the 1980s-90s, became contested through the 2000s, then reversed to high-pressure (consensus) by 2015-2018. Denialism became the new low-pressure position._
