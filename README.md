# Open Memetics Institute

How it started:

> I need something in between the Russian troll farms @bennjordan described, and like, a public research lab. An "open culture institute" that A/B tests people and publishes the result, for the general public

Memetics, or "culture science" is the study of (1) how narratives determine human behavior (2) how narratives spread & evolve. The evolution & propagation of memes (the genes of culture) happens naturally, and can also be directed governments & corporations. The most benign cases of this are companies launching marketing campaigns & A/B testing their product with the aim of changing consumer behavior. We aim to study this science openly for the public benefit, for our own protection & survival. 

We aim to form a collective of "white hat" hackers, and a community around finding & disclosing vulnerabilities, exactly the same way the cyber security industry does it, with conferences like [DEFCON]([https://defcon.org/](https://www.youtube.com/user/DEFCONConference)).
