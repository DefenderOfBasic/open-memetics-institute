# Open Memetics Institute

> I need something in between the Russian troll farms @bennjordan described, and like, a public research lab. An "open culture institute" that A/B tests people and publishes the result, for the general public

Memetics, or "culture science" is the study of (1) how narratives determine human behavior (2) how narratives spread & evolve. The evolution & propagation of memes (the genes of culture) happens naturally, and can also be directed governments & corporations. Memetic engineering is the art of intentionally changing the behavior of groups of humans by spreading specific narratives. We aim to study this science openly for the public benefit, for our own protection & survival. 

We aim to form a collective of "white hat" hackers, and a community around finding & disclosing vulnerabilities, exactly the same way the cyber security industry does it, with conferences like [DEFCON]([https://defcon.org/](https://www.youtube.com/user/DEFCONConference)).
