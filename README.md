# Open Memetics Institute

Studying memetics 100% in the open &amp; building the open source tools we need.

> I need something in between the Russian troll farms @bennjordan described, and like, a public research lab. An "open culture institute" that A/B tests people and publishes the result, for the general public

### Ground Zero TODO

- A "memetic science 101" essay
  - Open call for people to join us, memetic engineers, time to come out of hiding
  - (for others, we're loudly announcing ourselves, you can watch & use the data & tools we build. This puts us at a disadvantage, but it's a risk we take to pull off creating something we all need)
  - Ends with a list of "public memetic engineers". Starts out empty, people who write their own essays about their plan, research statement etc I will put them there. I can write my own as well
- Apply for funding https://github.com/DefenderOfBasic/open-memetics-institute/issues/1
