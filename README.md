# Open Memetics Institute

Studying memetics 100% in the open &amp; building the open source tools we need.

### Ground Zero TODO

- A "memetic science 101" essay
  - Open call for people to join us, memetic engineers, time to come out of hiding
  - (for others, we're loudly announcing ourselves, you can watch & use the data & tools we build. This puts us at a disadvantage, but it's a risk we take to pull off creating something we all need)
