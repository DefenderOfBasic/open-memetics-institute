**desired/pulled meme** - a unit of information that has a natural attraction to the observer, typically because it confers value upon contact. These are useful for measuring blockages in information pathways. 

_Example: a CEO wants to know why the project keeps getting delayed, the engineers on the factory floor have that information. In a neutral information environment (with no other forces acting upon this information), this would bubble up to the CEO. But if the middle managers would get punished if this becomes known, that creates a counter force._

_Example 2: a product is sold for $100, but the same (or better) version exists as free / public domain / open source. This is hypothetically a "desired meme". To prove that it is, expose a customer to this information (ideally in the gap between when they have the desire for the product but before they've committed to it) - if it leads to behavior change towards the cheaper one, that confirms it._

**epistemic noise** - any true information that makes it difficult to surface the truths the observer seeks. It's either irrelevant, or guides you towards false conclusions. 

_Example: the [Streisand Deflect](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Streisand+Deflect) is an example of an epistemic noise tactic - it injects true information into the system to hide a specific truth._

_Example 2: an engineer writing a design doc pointing out all the flaws in a proposed system, only because it threatens their team's headcount. Everything in the doc is true, but it fails to convince the discerning reader. It's designed to convince those with less discernment, like decision makers up the management chain_
